This code is a OpenCV 2.x C++ wrapper to low-level C code, for accessing the I420 encoded video stream from the Raspberry Pi's camera module.

To compile:

1. Install OpenCV 2.x and make sure proper environment variables are set 
2. Enable RPi camera module support from raspi-config
3. Clone the userland GitHub repository (https://github.com/raspberrypi/userland)
4. Modify line 13 of CMakeLists.txt (of this repository) and replace USERLAND_DIR with the path to the cloned userland repository
5. In this repository, run:
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  ./test

Because of the way the wrapper is written, grayscale video streams much faster than color video.

The OpenCV time measurement routines are interfered with in some way by the low level C code, and so the frame rates displayed by the test program might be inaccurate.
